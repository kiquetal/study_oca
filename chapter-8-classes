        public pertains only to top level classes and to member classes not to local classes  or
        anonymous classes The access modifiers protected and private  pertain only to member
        classes within a directly enclosing class or enum declaration The modifier

        It is a compile-time error if the same modifier appears more than once in a class
        declaration.
