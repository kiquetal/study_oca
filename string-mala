String object are never placed in the string pool.

String methods:
   trim
   replace (you can replace with char or string)

QueryString
 chatAt
 indexOf
 substring (doesn't include the end chart at position)

Other
 length
 startsWith
 endsWith

 Method equals,always Object

 instanceof

 java.lang

 String Builder.
 InitialCapacity is 16.

 QueryPosition
   charAt
   indexOf
   substring

  Modify
   append
   insert
   delete

  Others
   length
   trimToSize
   setLength
   reverse


   StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder("123");
char[] name = {'J', 'a', 'v', 'a'};
sb1.insert(1, name, 1, 3); (LENGTH)
System.out.println(sb1);  //will print 1ava3


public static void main(String args[]) {
StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder("0123456");
sb1.replace(2,4, "ABCD");
System.out.println(sb1); //01ABCD456

Method subsequence works the same as subtring,return object of Character type.

Array
 you can't creat new int[] without size
 you can't define whatever int.

 is ok
 int intArray[] = {0, 1};
String[] strArray = {"Summer", "Winter"};
int multiArray[][] = { {0, 1}, {3, 4, 5} };

But you canâ€™t miss the keyword new and initialize your array as follows:
int intArray[];
intArray = {0, 1};
compilation error.

ArrayList

It implements the interface List.
It allows null values to be added to it.
It implements all list operations ( add, modify , and delete values).
It allows duplicate values to be added to it.
It maintains its insertion order.
You can use either Iterator or ListIterator (an implementation of the
Iterator interface) to iterate over the items of an ArrayList.
It supports generics, making it type safe. (You have to declare the type of the
elements that should be added to an ArrayList with its declaration.)

initialCapacity 10.
